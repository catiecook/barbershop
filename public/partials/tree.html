    <p>After you make a proper walking stick, you wander around and start to hear sounds indicating that there's a river nearby. Probably a mile to the west. Earlier, you also heard that there's a cave the same distance to the east.</p>
    <p> Do you walk WEST to the river, or EAST to the cave?</p>
