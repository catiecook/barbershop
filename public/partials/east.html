    <p>You see a shiny thing towards the very back of the cave. You also notice right next to you is a makeshift stairwell that seems to go to a lower level of the cave.</p>
    <p>Do you go deeper into the cave to go check out that SHINY object, or do you go down the STAIRS to see what's going on down there?</p>
